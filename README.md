# 🪨 Rockfall Digital Twin – AI-Based Rockfall Prediction

This project aims to build a **Digital Twin–based Rockfall Prediction System** using:
- 3D terrain modeling  
- Real-time sensor data  
- Physics-based simulation  
- AI/ML surrogate models  

The goal is to predict **if/when/where** a rockfall may occur and estimate **runout distance, trajectory, and hazard levels**.
